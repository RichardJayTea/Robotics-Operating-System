# Robotics-Operating-System

This is a closed proprietary project and I will reframe from releasing the source code of the main components involved in this development.

The launch.cpp file is coded to create 3 child processes that consist of the main components needed for the system to run properly.

The executables that are being forked are simple one line scripts located in the bin.  These will run the roslaunch commands that corresponds to a specific launch file to activate proper nodes in ROS.
